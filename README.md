# Fresh Air DC

Fresh Air DC is a research project using low-cost uRAD monitors to establish an air quality monitoring network. The monitors are placed in the same locations as the Department of Energy and Environment (DOEE) to ensure that the data aligns with the Environmental Protection Agency’s Federal Regulatory Equipment.


I was tasked with coding a corrective function that ensures that the data collected aligns with the Environmental Protection Agency’s Federal Regulatory Equipment.
